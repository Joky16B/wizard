# WIZARD Card Game Rules

## Game Overview

**Players:** 3 to 6 apprentices  
**Age:** 10 and Up  
**Time:** Approximately 45 minutes  
**Designer:** Ken Fisher  
**Translation:** Craig S. Berg, Sr.  
**Contents:** 60 character cards, tablet of truth (scoresheet), 1 parchment of rules

## Background

Once upon a time, a long, long time ago, when there was still the famous Magician Academy in Stonehenge, the Apprentices had to learn this game for the training of their magic abilities along with other exercises. It served to develop and strengthen their gift of prediction. 

Over the years, a deeper understanding of the game has been lost. An entertaining card game, which was often played in hotels by workmen, farmers, and soldiers, is all that remains. Only after the famous English archaeologist Dr. Hensch Stone dug deeply under the standing stones of Stonehenge and discovered historical parchment scrolls in old vaults did the true history of Wizard again come to light. 

The following rules correspond with the wording of the age-old parchments. The illustrations on the cards give the feeling for the old participants.

## The Task

With this magic pack of cards the Apprentices must predict the exact number of tricks they will win in each round. Experience Points are awarded for a correct forecast. Whoever collected the most points at the end of the game wins and with that success will ascend to the level of a wise Wizard.

## The Preparation

One player is appointed the Confidant of the Apprentices. The Confidant receives the Tablet of Truth, enters the names of the players, and conscientiously keeps track of Experience Points awarded during the game. Afterwards the Confidant shuffles the character cards and deals them out.

## The Character Cards

- There are four different colors: Humans (blue), Elves (green), Dwarves (red), Giants (yellow)
- The strongest card in each color is the "13", the weakest card is the "1"
- The four Wizard cards ("Z") are always Trump. They are higher than every "13"
- The four Fool cards ("N") are never Trump. They are lower than every "1"

## Distributing the Cards

- With "Wizard" the Apprentices receive a different number of cards in each round
- In the first round only one card is dealt to each player. Therefore, only one trick can be won in this round
- In the second round two cards are dealt to each player. In this round there are two tricks to win
- In the third round three cards are dealt to each player, then four cards in the fourth round, etc. until in the last round all cards are dealt out to the players
- Cards that are not dealt to the players form a face down deck in the middle of the table. For each round the role of the dealer passes clockwise to the next Apprentice to the left

## Trump

- After the cards are dealt out, the top card of the deck is turned face up. This card determines the Trump color for the current round
- If the card is a Fool, then there is no Trump in the current round
- If the card is a Wizard, then the dealer determines Trump. He may examine his cards first
- The last round has no Trump, since there are no cards left

## The Predictions

After each Apprentice looks at his cards, he must predict how many tricks he will take in this round. Each Apprentice in sequence tells their predictions to the Confidant. This starts with the player to the left of the dealer. These bids are noted on the Tablet of Truth.

## The Battle for the Trick

The player to the left of the dealer plays the first card for the first trick. The other Apprentices follow in a clockwise direction. The led color must be followed. If that is not possible, an Apprentice can throw off any color or play Trump.

**Note:** Wizard and Fool cards may always be played, even if a player could follow the led color. Also a player does not have to play them when he cannot follow a led color.

The highest card wins the trick (the Wizard cards are higher than all other cards, even the Trump cards). The winner opens the next trick. Exception: in the first round only one trick is played.

### Who wins the trick:

- The first Wizard card played in the trick
- Or the highest card in the Trump color
- Or the highest card in the led color

## Special Rights of the Wizards and Fools

- When a trick is opened with a Wizard, then the following Apprentices may throw off any cards, including further Wizards and Fools
- The trick goes to the first Wizard played
- Wizards are Trump, however, they need not be played when the first card of a trick is an actual Trump color card
- If a trick is opened with a Fool then any card may be played as the second card. Then second card's color determines the color that must be followed
- Fools lose every trick, with one exception: In a trick that only Fools are played, the first Fool card wins the trick. This is possible only with three or four players

## The Assignment of the Experience Points

The Apprentice who predicted the number of tricks won exactly receives 20 Experience Points plus 10 points per trick won. Anyone that missed their bid loses 10 Experience Points for each trick over or under their prediction.

## Example

### First Round
Thomas predicted that he would not take a trick. He was right and receives 20 points. Ute wanted the trick, but did not get it. He loses 10 points. Kevin predicted that he would take the trick, he was right and receives, with the trick, 30 points.

### Second Round
Thomas predicted both tricks for himself, however, he got only one. Result: he loses 10 points. Ute wanted no tricks and was right. He receives 20 points. Kevin predicted no tricks likewise for himself. However, he got one and therefore loses 10 points. The points are noted and added to the points from the previous rounds.

## The End

There are 60 character cards in the game. The Apprentices play until, in the last round, all cards are dealt out. With 6 players that is 10 rounds, with 5 players 12, with 4 players 15, and with 3 players that is 20 rounds. The last round is still scored. The Apprentice with the highest Experience score wins.
